# SahiCoin
Basicly with every swipe it synchronizes latest coin prices and USD/TRY value from doviz.com

You can set alarms for specific prices for example "When price is over 1000 USD" or "When price is under 500 USD".
With this alarms you can keep track for specific point for yourself. Also with a little effort, unfortunately couldn't finish it in time, ypu could set buy or sell actions with these specific prices.

What happened? Tried to write a Java-Spring application but I ran out of ideas to make an "useful" service, I had no time and enough data for any AI project but I forced myself to use Java-Spring but it was the wrong choice for this kind of project, at least for me, most useful project for me with this time limit would be the Android application which alerts you


It was a nice experience, enjoyed to be a part of it.

Thanks to everyoune who shared their time with us.
